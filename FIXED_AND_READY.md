# ✅ Application Fixed and Ready!

## Issue Resolved

**Problem**: The application was trying to use `IdentityUser` instead of `ApplicationUser`

**Solution**:
1. Updated `_LoginPartial.cshtml` to inject and use `ApplicationUser`
2. Created custom `AccountController` with Login, Register, and Logout actions
3. Created custom Login and Register views
4. All Identity services now properly use `ApplicationUser`
