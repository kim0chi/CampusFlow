# Setup Verification

## âœ… System Status: READY TO RUN

### What's Configured

1. **âœ… .NET 9.0 SDK**: Installed and working
2. **âœ… SQLite Database**: Bundled via NuGet package (Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite v9.0.9)
3. **âœ… Database File**: `app.db` already created (104 KB)
4. **âœ… Database Type**: SQLite 3.x
5. **âœ… Migrations**: Applied successfully
6. **âœ… Build Status**: Successful (2 minor warnings, 0 errors)

### No Additional Installation Needed!

You do **NOT** need to install SQLite separately. The SQLite engine is embedded in the application through the NuGet package.

### How SQLite Works in This Project

The `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite` package includes:
- Native SQLite binaries for Windows, Linux, and macOS
- All necessary database functionality
- Full EF Core integration

When you run the application, it uses the bundled SQLite library to:
- Create the database file (`app.db`)
- Execute SQL commands
- Manage transactions
- Handle all database operations

### Ready to Run Commands

```bash
# Build the project
dotnet build

# Run the application
dotnet run
```

Then open: **https://localhost:5001**

### What Happens on First Run

When you run `dotnet run`, the application will:

1. âœ… Check if database exists
2. âœ… Apply any pending migrations
3. âœ… Seed initial data if database is empty:
   - **7 users** (1 admin, 5 approvers, 1 student)
   - **8 courses** across 4 departments
4. âœ… Start web server on ports 5000/5001

### Verification Checklist

- [x] .NET 9.0 SDK installed
- [x] Project created with authentication
- [x] SQLite NuGet package installed
- [x] Database context configured
- [x] Models and enums created
- [x] Workflow service implemented
- [x] Controllers created
- [x] Views built
- [x] Database migrations applied
- [x] Database file created
- [x] Sample data seeded
- [x] Project builds successfully

### Database Location

The SQLite database file is located at:
```
/home/kimo/Documents/Code/StudentEnrollmentSystem/app.db
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Database locked**: Close any SQLite browser tools
2. **Port in use**: Change ports in `Properties/launchSettings.json`
3. **Fresh start**: Delete `app.db` and run again (will recreate with seed data)

### Next Steps

1. Run the application: `dotnet run`
2. Open browser to: https://localhost:5001
3. Login as a student: john.doe@student.edu / Student123!
4. Browse courses and create an enrollment
5. Test the approval workflow with different role accounts

**Everything is ready to go! ðŸš€**
